Stinky was rescued by Jerry's cousin as a 4 day old kitten found in her yard near her doorstep.  She couldn't take on the responsibility of caring for him, so called us for a rescue.  She had Stinky checked out by a local vet, who said he would be fine if we bottle fed him diligently.  His name was originally \"Jeremy Stinksworth the 4th\" (she and her children picked the Jeremy and our daughter picked the Stinksworth the 4th).  We bottle fed him with the equipment recommended for baby squirrels (inspired by the great Bob Ross -- maybe a link to a video with squirrel?), while wearing a pink fleece glove.  The glove wasn't enough protection against claws and teeth, but he did just fine.  He went for many car rides in his first month, as Jerry's mom was at a rehab center after a \"medical procedure.\"  She was delighted to see him in his carrier, and the facility was fine with small, relatively quiet furry visitors. Stinky has long been a fan of computers. He was very fond of sitting on our younger son's shoulders to supervise computer activity.  Now he likes to walk in front of the monitor of the Mac Mini and make helpful suggestions to the human at the keyboard about snack time.\r\n\r\nStinky is a very \"helpful\" cat.  He loves to help warp my <a href=\"https:\/\/schachtspindle.com\/item\/cricket-loom\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cricket<\/a> rigid heddle loom.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-69\" src=\"http:\/\/www.catswithcomputers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/stinky-in-cricket-small-copy-300x180.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" \/>\r\n\r\nHe has a \"sensitive stomach\"... which means he often hurls his latest meal.  Cleaning up after him has always been a bit of a pain, but with the addition of Fluffy2 and her sister Fuzz to the household, we don't have to clean it up ourselves.  When we hear the familiar Stinky \"about to barf\" sound, it's a race of those two and any humans to the spot.  If Fuzz is first, she tries to eat the \"early\" barf, while the \"continuing\" barf lands on her head.  Yes, we have wiped the top of her head clean, although her sister Fluff often volunteers to clean her sister's head.  Stinky's short meals have increased over the years, and he would prefer to follow the Hobbit (link?) meal system.\r\n\r\nStinky generally likes other cats, and will often let them nap with him, although he rarely seeks out another cat.  He accepted Pepper, the beagle who was alive during Stinky's first years.  When we took in Biff the Boxer after the death of Jerry's father, we set up child gates to provide \"safe\" areas for the cats.  Biff disliked cats, although he never knew any personally before joining our household.  Biff had the couch, and the cats had the kitchen.  One day Biff had a pre-cancerous spot removed and was resting on the couch, very mellow from the pain killer.  Stinky suddenly decided he wanted to sit on the couch, and hopped up beside Biff.  Biff just looked at him but didn't bark or lunge at him.  From that day until Biff's death, he and Stinky would share the couch.\r\n\r\nLately he has offered to help solder.... by nudging human hands.",
